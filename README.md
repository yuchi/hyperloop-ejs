# [Appcelerator’s Hyperloop][0]-oriented [EJS][1] Syntax

> Simply put: a gift for [Tony Lukasavage][2].

## Installation

Use [Package Control][3] to install the `EJS` package.

Then you can simply install this one, searching for `”hyperloop”`.
If you cannot find it (probably it is not already in the default channel) you can install it by adding `https://github.com/yuchi/hyperloop-ejs` as a repository.
