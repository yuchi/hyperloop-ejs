# [Appceleratorâ€™s Hyperloop][0]-oriented [EJS][1] Syntax

> Simply put: a gift for [Tony Lukasavage][2].

## Installation (for ST)

If you cannot find it on Package Control as `Hyperloop EJS` (probably because it is not already in the default channel) you can install it by adding `https://github.com/yuchi/hyperloop-ejs` as a repository and then search for `hyperloop-ejs`.
